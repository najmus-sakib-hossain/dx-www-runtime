# Clippy Configuration for dx-www-runtime
# Note: Clippy doesn't support per-lint configuration in clippy.toml
# Use #[allow(clippy::lint_name)] attributes or Cargo.toml for lint configuration
# This file is for clippy-specific settings only

# Cognitive complexity threshold
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Documentation note:
# To configure lint levels, add to Cargo.toml:
# [lints.clippy]
# perf = "deny"
# correctness = "deny"
# style = "warn"
# Or use #![warn(clippy::perf)] in lib.rs/main.rs
